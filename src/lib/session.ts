'use server'

// This file is no longer needed for getting the session on the server,
// as the session is now managed entirely on the client-side with localStorage.
// You can keep it if you plan to reintroduce server-side session logic later,
// but for the current architecture, it's unused.

// The primary session logic now resides in `src/hooks/use-session.tsx`.
